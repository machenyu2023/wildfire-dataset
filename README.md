# Wildfire Susceptibility Assessment Dataset

This repository contains a dataset designed for training a **Wildfire Susceptibility Assessment Model**. The dataset has been collected through the **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** platform and is intended to help in evaluating and predicting areas at risk of wildfire based on various environmental factors.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multi-source information that identifies the environmental conditions conducive to wildfire occurrence. The data has been labeled using **MODIS** (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and it combines various environmental factors to assess wildfire susceptibility.

### Key Features of the Dataset:

- **Data Source**: The dataset is primarily collected from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, which is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis.
- **Labeling Method**: Fire occurrences are labeled using **MODIS** satellite data, which provides frequent, global coverage of land surface conditions.
- **Multi-source Fusion**: The dataset integrates multiple data sources, including vegetation indices, temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables that influence wildfire behavior and occurrence.

### Purpose of the Dataset

This dataset is designed for use in developing models that assess wildfire susceptibility. The goal is to predict areas that are at higher risk of experiencing wildfires, helping to support wildfire prevention efforts and improve disaster management.
